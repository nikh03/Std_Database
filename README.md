# Std_Database
Modern handheld devices such as smartphones have become increasingly powerful in recent years.
As mobile devices become more like PCs they will come to replace objects we tend to carry around such as checkbooks, credit cards, cameras, planners, mp3 players, etc. 
We will be using them to accomplish our daily tasks. One application that falls into this category is to store data. Current database storage often offers decryption of data but few have been applied to online commerce.

The project has the following objectives:
•	To provide Android Mobile Application that will enable storing a student database.
•	It will help in showing the details and full information about the enrolled students.
•	We can store the Roll No, Name, Email, Courses, Marks and other student-related information in the database.
•	This application is more likely for a teacher, professors, etc.
